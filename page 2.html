          Despite his ongoing cancer battle, King Charles III maintained a key tradition during the 2024 Trooping the Colour ceremony on Saturday, June 15, appearing alongside other members of the royal family on the Buckingham Palace balcony.
           The monarch, 75, stood beside wife Queen Camilla to watch a flypast performed by the Royal Air Force after the annual parade that took place earlier in the day. 
                The event marked Charles’ most publicized appearance since announcing his cancer diagnosis.
            Charles and Camilla, 76, were joined by his son Prince William, Princess Kate Middleton and their three kids: Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 5.
                The king frequently chatted to Kate, 42, who is also battling a form of cancer, throughout the occasion.
                Charles’ siblings Prince Edward and Princess Anne were also present on the balcony, as were their respective spouses. Edward and Duchess Sophie‘s daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, made an appearance as well.
               Slight modifications were made to Trooping the Colour due to Charles’ condition.
                Although he rode on horseback alongside the military during the parade in 2023, which was his first time attending the ceremony as king, he opted to make the journey from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards in a carriage this year.
                “We already know at this stage that the king had hoped to ride on horseback as was tradition,” royal historian Gareth Russell exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, June 10. 
                “But his doctors have been quite clear given his ongoing cancer treatment, it’d be better if he was in a carriage.

          Britain’s royals suffered a double blow in 2024: two of the most senior members of the family are now battling cancer. 
          King Charles III was diagnosed in early February, just 17 months into his reign. 
          The 75-year-old monarch’s daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, underwent a “planned” abdominal procedure in January, then was not seen in public for several months.
           Following wild speculation about her condition and whereabouts, the princess shared devastating news on March 22: she has also been diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing “a course of preventative chemotherapy.”
           Here’s a roundup, which we’ll keep updated, of the latest news about the king and the princess’s health, and how Britain’s royal family is handling the situation.
            </p>
        <h2>What type of cancer does Kate Middleton have?</h2>
        <p>
          
           We don’t know.
           On January 17 Kensington Palace announced that the 42-year-old Princess of Wales had undergone a “planned abdominal surgery” at The London Clinic the previous day.
          The statement said she was “unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter” and expressed “her wish that her personal medical information remains private.”
          At the time, a royal source told CNN that Kate Middleton’s condition was noncancerous.
           But as the princess explained in a video posted March 22, that diagnosis changed.
            “The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present,” she said.
           “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventati
          What has Prince William said about his wife’s health?
           After taking several weeks off to support his wife, Prince William returned to public duties on April 18 with a visit to a food charity. William mentioned Kate while visiting a high school on April 25, telling a staff member, “I am sorry Catherine can’t be here as well. She would have loved to.”
            While greeting members of the public on April 30 at James’ Place Newcastle in England a woman asked Prince William “Do you mind if I ask how your wife and children are?” He replied, “We’re all doing well, thank you.” 
             The woman asked, “And obviously Catherine?” and William said, “We’re all doing well.”
          When asked if the princess is “getting any better” while meeting with World War II veterans in Portsmouth, England on June 5, William said, “Yes,” adding, “She would’ve loved to be here today.”

        <h3>What kind of cancer does King Charles have?</h3>
        <p>
          
          We don’t know the type of cancer Charles has, or its stage. 
          Buckingham Palace announced the king’s diagnosis on February 5, a week after he was released from a London hospital following unrelated treatment for an enlarged prostate.
           The statement read:
          During The King’s recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. 
          Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer. 
           His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties.
            Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.
          The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure.
           He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.
